## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Muted** | **bool** | Specifies if a call participant is muted or not. **Note:** If a call is also controlled via Hard phone or RingCentral App (not only through the API by calling call control methods) then it cannot be fully muted/unmuted via API only, in this case the action should be duplicated via Hard phone/RC App interfaces | [optional] 
**StandAlone** | **bool** | If &#39;True&#39; then the party is not connected to a session voice conference, &#39;False&#39; means the party is connected to other parties in a session | [optional]
